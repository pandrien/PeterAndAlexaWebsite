		<p>We met in 2010 at Harvey Mudd College during a summer program for new students called Summer Institute. Summer Institute was packed with lots of fun activities designed to help new students get to know each other and acclimate to college life.</p>
		
		<img class="cimg" SRC="Boojum2.jpg">
		<p>We have especially fond memories of a trip that we took during Summer Institute to a ropes course called Boojum, where we did team building activities including swinging on a rope and balancing on a wire high up in the trees.</p>

		<p>As our friendship grew, one of our favorite activities was a week-long game that happened every semester called Humans vs. Zombies, where humans try to defend themselves using toy Nerf Blasters. We had fun every semester surviving together, protecting each other, and hunting other Humans after turning into Zombies.		Right before the final mission of the game we snapped a photo in all our gear. Out of 8 games, we each survived to the final mission as humans 3 times.</p>

		<p>As we slowly fell in love, we bonded over active college games and activities, including “Battle Tie Dye”, an annual event where students color white t-shirts with dye soaked pool toys.</p>

		<p>We wanted to spend more time together, so we combined this with our love for music and dance. Claremont has a vibrant ballroom dance community and puts on many event including an annual masquerade (above) and Black & White Ball (below).</p>

		<p>We love dancing with each other, whether it’s ballroom, ballet, hip hop, or making up our own moves.</p>

		<p>It just so happens we both didn’t go to Prom, so when Harvey Mudd College had a throwback to high school prom, we couldn’t resist taking a study break.</p>

		<p>We got engaged at the Huntington Gardens in March of 2014. Peter proposed to Alexa in front of a beautiful lily pond, and of course Alexa said yes!</p>

		<p>Today, a year later now, Peter is working for Microsoft in Redmond, Washington and Alexa is attending graduate school in mathematics at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington.</p>
